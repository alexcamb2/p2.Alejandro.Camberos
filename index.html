    <p>To get an C: I thought about creating a canvas for the mirror instead of having the entire screen become the mirror. I did this so i can space stuff out the way i want it to. I added a news feed, the important vitals such as sleep and weight, and time.</p>

    <p>To get a B: For the vitals, I choose to add circles with 2 diffrent colors to compare things such as light and dark sleep. I added a calender with important times for that day as well as a clock next to it. For the weather, I added the temperature in Celcius and an image depending on if its cloudy or sunny or rainy.</p>
      
    <p>To get an A: I added the ability to customize where the boxes are and you can move them around.</p>
